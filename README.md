# UC Simple Student Help Chatbot (AWS Lex V2)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **student help desk chatbot** built using **AWS Lex V2**, **AWS Lambda**, **JavaScript (HTML/CSS)**, and **index.json**.  
It is designed to assist students with common queries related to university services, such as course registration, campus facilities, and academic resources.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

For this academic project, AWS credentials are shown as placeholders in the JavaScript file.  
Due to time limitations and the complexity of securely managing authentication, I was not able to implement full security best practices.  

However, in a **real production environment**, credentials must never be exposed in client-side code. Instead:

1. **Use IAM Roles with restricted permissions**  
   - Provides temporary, limited-scope credentials for interacting with AWS services (such as Lex).  

2. **Move sensitive credentials to server-side code (Lambda or a backend API)**  
   - The frontend should never directly contain AWS keys.  
   - A secure backend service handles requests and communicates with AWS resources.  

3. **Never hardcode credentials in public repositories**  
   - Hardcoding exposes your AWS account to misuse and possible cost/security risks.  

➡️ In this project, keys are replaced with placeholders and comments to demonstrate integration only. No real credentials are published.
